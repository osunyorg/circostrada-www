Brugge Plus vzw, the non-profit organisation hosting the event, has 3 special tricks up its sleeve.Cirque Plus rests upon three pillars:  <br> It is an  outdoor festival   because we believe that artistic work outside theatre walls can lower barriers and connect diverse audiences. Cirque Plus aims to highlight the power and beauty of this connecting value.  <br> Under the title of  Cirque Numerique , Cirque Plus also provides an opportunity for circus artists who do not yet have a fully completed show under their belt. We provide a stage to introduce them to you by showing what they have worked hard on. In January there is an open call for Cirque Numerique.  <br> Circus is a way of creating opportunities, questioning ways of thinking and representing. As an  inclusive circus  festival, we provide a platform for people with disabilities to explore new artistic avenues. </p>
